Simulating card games using F#

This is a playground to practice and learn F#, the idea is simulate some Rummy card games (at least the basic steps) such as poker.

The first implementation gonna be Texas holdem poker. Feel free to comment fork it :)

This idea came from this [https://blog.markvincze.com/a-data-model-exercise-in-two-languages-part-2-f/](https://blog.markvincze.com/a-data-model-exercise-in-two-languages-part-2-f/) from @Mark Vincze. Check it out :)
